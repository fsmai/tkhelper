# tkhelper
A helper module for tkinter

The module provides:
- the alias 'tk' and 'ttk' for the tkinter and ttk modules for python 2 and 3.
- the decorator 'command' to easily build factories of commands.
- the Plot class to help the integration of matplotlib with tkinter.

Note: forget pack() and use grid() to place the element in the window.
